After many years working in financial markets and real estate markets and finishing
a master’s degree and an MBA in those fields respectively, a great change has been placed
and steered life objectives and a vision of future into the artificial intelligence world.
Since then a second master has been done in order to start a new career in this domain.

Projects have been accomplished since the master’s graduation. A journey in the machine
learning and its most known branches have already started, and the point of no return has
been reached but the pace forward does not slacken, instead it only speeds up. 
A thirst for knowledge has been placed, and this road gives no sight of its end,
even if it might take forever, a smile is put on the face.

A PhD opportunity in Artificial intelligence is sought, so if you can help an enthusiastic
artificial intelligence student to reach his dreams and help the humanity with new 
researches and possible developments in this field, send a message to Marco Djun Sera at:
